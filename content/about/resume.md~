## Experience

### Work

**PhD Student: LaBRI** (Dec. 2023 - Nov. 2024)

_**Physical layer Security**_

- State of the art
	- read papers
	- understand technology and context (LoRa, low power devices, ...)
	- getting familiar with the hardware (STM32 devices with **SX1276** LoRa transceivers)
- Paper writting (stopped): Compare _quantization_ methods of Key Generation systems found in literature (+ some methods untested for LoRa)
	- Implement LoRa Key Generation system from scratch (in C)
		- this one is general compared to prior work in 2021 and can handle various methods at each phase of the Key Generation procedure
	- Write a tool for configuring devices equipped with KeyGen system and logging telemetry data (in Rust)
	- Write various utilities (in Python and Rust)

_I did stop my PhD because I was not happy working on this subject_ :(

**Intern: Defense Ministery** (Mar. 2023 - Aug. 2023)

_**Embedded Linux Security**_

Using Reverse Engineering and Fuzzing to test security of an embedded linux device.
- reversing on IDA Pro 
	- basic python scripting
- emulation + fuzzing using [Unicorn Engine](https://www.unicorn-engine.org/) and [AFL++](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/unicornafl)
- tooling in Python

_I will not respond to any questions related to this work_

**Intern: LaBRI** (May 2021 - Aug. 2021)

_**Implementation of a Physical layer based key generation system**_

- Understand **Physical layer based security** (read papers)
- [**LoRa** Technology](https://lora.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- Work on **FiPy** devices (use an ESP32) from _Pycom_
	- use a modified micropython stack
- Modify Pycom firmware to implement the key generation procedure ([our fork](https://github.com/yocvito/pycom-micropython-sigfox), look at **PHYSEC** branch)
	- implement [LoRa-Key paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8580375)

**Intern: INVISSYS** (Apr. 2019 - June 2019)

_**Developpment of a solution for getting logs of a large number of embedded devices**_

- Work on STM32 devices with LoRa capibilities
- Design and Implement gathering of STM32 logs from a Raspberry Pi
	- Use an intermediary STM32 device for collecting logs as UART and sending them to RPI using I2C
	- Use basic system programming in C for I2C communication 



### Projects

Here is non exhaustive list of my projects to get an idea of what I've worked on.

⚠️ **WARNING** ⚠️<span style="line-height:2;"></span>   
_I do not endorse illegal activities. Some of my projects are educational explorations that could be misapplied. To prevent misuse, certain code isn't publicly available but can be shared upon [request](mailto:yocvito.f@pm.me) after careful consideration._



| Project Name | Brief | Link (if available) |
|--------------|-------|---------------------|
| Flipper: Bad BLE | Add Bluetooth capability to the BadUSB application of Flipper Zero | [Community Firmware with the feature](https://github.com/Next-Flip/Momentum-Firmware) |
| Linux Rootkit (PoC) | Linux rootkit with basic features (process/file/port hiding, backdoors (root, reverse-shell, ssh), ...).  | _not public (but you can find another rootkit PoC [here](/posts/linux-rootkit))_ |
| Flipper: LoRa Toolkit | Add LoRa capability to Flipper using an [ESP32 external board](https://heltec.org/project/wifi-lora-32v2/) | _not finished ([link to demo](/projects/flipper_lora_toolkit))_ |
| Kobalos-rs | Implementing the Kobalos malware obfuscation technique in Rust proc-macros | _not finished ([link to demo](/projects/kobalos-rs))_ |
